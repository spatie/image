Image manipulation doesn't have to be hard. Here are a few examples on how this package makes it very easy to manipulate images.

```php
use Spatie\Image\Image;

// modifying the image so it fits in a 100x100 rectangle without altering aspect ratio
Image::load($pathToImage)
   ->width(100)
   ->height(100)
   ->save($pathToNewImage);
   
// overwriting the original image with a greyscale version   
Image::load($pathToImage)
   ->greyscale()
   ->save();
   
// make image darker and save it in low quality
Image::load($pathToImage)
   ->brightness(-30)
   ->quality(25)
   ->save();
   
// rotate the image and sharpen it
Image::load($pathToImage)
   ->orientation(90)
   ->sharpen(15)
   ->save();
```
